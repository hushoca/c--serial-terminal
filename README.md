About
-------------
I have been using a python serial terminal which I wrote about a year ago for quick jobs. But then I realized I kept using it so it's time to UPGRADE!

To be honest I formatted my PC and I am too lazy to install Python. So I did the most logical thing and I wrote another serial terminal application. This time brought to you by C# and .NET!

Thanks Microsoft... Not really... But you are cool. Hire me please... Nevermind...

Features:
-------------
**Version 1.0.2**
> - Now saves settings for next session.
> - Has 3 data display settings hex,binary,ascii
> - has more connection settings like bit rate, end bit type, parity.
> - Can set a break counter decides how many data points are shown on one lines.
> - Carriage Return on/off functionality when sending messages.


**Version 1.0.1**
> - Added ability to disconnect (yep.. I forgot the add that 3 lines of code)
> - When started scans for ports automaticly.
> - Now selects the first com port on the list.

**Version 1.0**
> - Keeps track of sent and received data (definition of serial terminal... duh)
> - Can search for serial ports... (I have seen some crappy terminals which could only use COM1 to 3...)
> - Basicly a serial terminal with open source... what else do you need?
 

Feel free to use source-code in anyway. Or modify the already built application. It's open-source do whatever you want!
